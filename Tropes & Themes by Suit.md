## **Band Name Generator**

Using a deck of cards, you can generate the band's name by drawing a combination of two cards. The suits determine the type of word (adjective or noun), and the values determine the specific word.

#### **How It Works:**

- **First Card**: Determines an adjective (or the first part of a compound noun).
- **Second Card**: Determines a noun (or the second part of the compound noun).

### **Adjective/Noun Assignments:**

|**Card Value**|**Hearts (Adjectives)**|**Diamonds (Adjectives)**|**Clubs (Nouns)**|**Spades (Nouns)**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Ace**|Loud|Resilient|Echo|Riot|
|**2**|Proud|Fierce|Wave|Anthem|
|**3**|Brave|Rising|Dream|Silence|
|**4**|True|Marching|Unity|Freedom|
|**5**|Bold|Bold|Noise|Revolution|
|**6**|Passionate|Strong|Voice|Fire|
|**7**|Wild|Echoing|Thunder|Horizon|
|**8**|Transcendent|Defiant|Power|Light|
|**9**|United|Everlasting|Heart|Vortex|
|**10**|Fierce|Radiant|Pulse|Storm|
|**Jack**|Electric|Waking|Wave|Shadow|
|**Queen**|Courageous|Burning|Journey|Ember|
|**King**|Enduring|Unstoppable|Anthem|Legacy|

**How to Use:**

1. **Draw the first card**: If you draw the 4 of Hearts, your adjective is "True."
2. **Draw the second card**: If you draw the Ace of Clubs, your noun is "Echo."
3. **Combine them**: Your band name could be _"True Echo."_

## **Song Name Generator**

The song name generator works similarly, with the first card providing a theme or action word and the second card providing a concept or object.

### **Theme/Concept Assignments:**

|**Card Value**|**Hearts (Theme/Action)**|**Diamonds (Theme/Action)**|**Clubs (Concept/ Object)**|**Spades (Concept/ Object)**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Ace**|Resilient|Marching|Heart|Freedom|
|**2**|Rising|Breaking|Silence|Revolution|
|**3**|Uniting|Defying|Dream|Fire|
|**4**|Shining|Building|Noise|Horizon|
|**5**|Fighting|Echoing|Power|Light|
|**6**|Standing|Blazing|Voice|Shadow|
|**7**|Surviving|Radiating|Pulse|Storm|
|**8**|Believing|Shattering|Anthem|Vortex|
|**9**|Embracing|Rising|Journey|Legacy|
|**10**|Liberating|Uniting|Thunder|Echo|
|**Jack**|Protecting|Burning|Light|Anthem|
|**Queen**|Empowering|Defending|Wave|Flame|
|**King**|Challenging|Transforming|Horizon|Ember|

**How to Use:**

1. **Draw the first card**: If you draw the 3 of Spades, your theme/action is "Surviving."
2. **Draw the second card**: If you draw the 10 of Clubs, your concept/object is "Journey."
3. **Combine them**: Your song name could be _"Surviving the Journey."_
